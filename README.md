# Training Data Analysis – Power BI

## Project overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing training data from 2019–2021.
It was created as part of skill development using knowledge gained during the Power BI course at Santander Open Academy.

The goal of the project was to transform raw training data into meaningful insights using KPIs,
time analysis and interactive visualizations.

## Data source
Educational training dataset provided within Santander Open Academy materials.

## Tools & technologies
- Power BI
- Excel (data preparation)

## Scope of analysis
- Key KPIs: number of courses, total training hours, average hours per course
- Training structure analysis (Excel, Word, Access, etc.)
- Time-of-day analysis of trainings
- Trend analysis over time (2019–2021)
- Interactive filters (country, course type)

## Key insights
- Trainings were predominantly conducted in the afternoon
- Excel and Word courses generated the highest number of training hours
- Significant decrease in activity in 2020 with recovery in 2021
- Differences in training structure depending on country

## Outcome
The project demonstrates practical skills in:
- data modeling and transformation
- KPI design
- building clear and interactive dashboards
- translating data into business insights

This dashboard is part of my data analytics portfolio.
